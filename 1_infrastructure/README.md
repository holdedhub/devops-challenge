# Infrastructure provisioning
This repo contains the instructions to deploy a GKE cluster using Terraform. The gcloud commands are provided but the same can be done from the GCP console

## Architecture
We will create a highly available [regional cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/regional-clusters#regional) with the control plane and nodes replicated across three zones of a region.

## Prerequisites
Before trying to provision the infrastructure, you need:
* A [GCP account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (free-tier is enough)
* The [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and configured with your GCP account
* The [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
* The [terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) installed

## Create a new project
This is not mandatory but it is good to keep the resources separate
```
gcloud projects create --name=devops-challenge --quiet
```
We save the project ID in a variable for later use
```
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud projects list --filter="name: devops-challenge" --format="value(projectId)")
```
Before you can create resources, you have to link the project with a billing account. You can do it with the command
```
gcloud beta billing projects link $PROJECT_ID --billing-account=0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X
```
Replace `0X0X0X-0X0X0X-0X0X0X` with your billing account ID

Finally, enable the services you need to use with the command
```
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com
```

## Create the Terraform service account
These commands create the service account and grants the permissions
```
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform-automation \
  --display-name="Terraform Service Account" \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID
```
```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:terraform-automation@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/editor"
```
Note: For the sake of simplicity we granted the `Editor` role to the service account. This role allows create and delete most of the GCP resources.
From a security perspective, we should enforce the principle of least privilege and grant only the specific roles needed.

Finally, we download the service account private key that will be used later with the terraform CLI
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/terraform-automation-key.json \
  --iam-account="terraform-automation@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

## Create the Terraform backend storage
Create a bucket on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) where Terraform store its state
```
gsutil mb -p $PROJECT_ID -c REGIONAL -l europe-west6 -b on gs://devops-challenge-tfstate
```
Feel free to change the region at your convenience

Enable object versioning for the bucket to keep old versions of the state
```
gsutil versioning set on gs://devops-challenge-tfstate
```
Note: It is recommended to set also a lifecycle rule to the bucket to automatically delete old versions

## Provision the infrastructure
Before running the terraform commands you have to configure the credentials to authenticate with the GCP API. We will specify the service account key file created before using the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS environment variable
```
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=~/terraform-automation-key.json
```

Edit the `terraform.tfvars` and set *your* project ID and the region. Alternatively, you can set the environment variables `GOOGLE_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_REGION`

Run this command to download the required modules and initialize the backend
```
terraform init
```
Run this command to create the resouces
```
terraform apply
```

Finally, fetch the Kubernetes credentials to use with kubectl
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $(terraform output -raw cluster_name) \
  --region $(terraform output -raw region)
```
By default, credentials are written to ~/.kube/config. You can provide an alternate path by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.
